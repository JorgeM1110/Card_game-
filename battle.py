            - checking if a card is already there (don't want to overwrite)
            - If currPlayer is full, player can only either sacerfice, draw a squirrel, or end turn 
        At each end turn, whoever turn is it, their card deals damage to the opposing entity 
            - Add/Subtract to scale if there is no card blocking or the card attack is airborne and the card opposing can't block it 
        add the villian turn
            - Randomly choose an enemy card and place it in it's upcoming_attack where the player can see what is comming next
            - Move the upcoming_attack to curr_attack and replace upcoming_attack if we want it to continue, so we can have 2 - 3 rounds where the villian has a chance to places a card 
            - Deals damage to player or player's card 
        Once everything works (so just simple health, power, and cost), work on sigil, and items
        Maybe add a put down card, if the user chooses a card but then changes their mind
